The simulation part of our application is implemented in java and creates a text output file

Run the simulation part:
- run the Main class of the project in an IDE;it requires as first argument the ABSOLUTE path to the text file describing
    the graph and the starting positions and as second argument the algorithm to use for the moving target search
    (either "mtdstar" or "astar")
OR
- navigate to moving-target-search\out\production\Moving Target Search\
- run the main.Main class of the java project; it requires as first argument the ABSOLUTE path to the text file describing
    the graph and the starting positions and as second argument the algorithm to use for the moving target search
    (either "mtdstar" or "astar")
    -> e.g.: java main.Main C:\Users\lukas\Documents\moving-target-search\src\parser\stockholm_graph.txt mtdstar

- use the file moving-target-search\src\parser\stockholm_graph.txt to get the graph we used
- the program will create an output file named output_<time in millis>.txt located in the moving-target-search\ folder
- this file is the result of the program and contains the catch log
- for an explanation of the output file, look at sample_output.txt
